# Geo Waste - Location Guessing Game

This is a guessing game where the goal is to identify the correct location based on an image displayed on the screen. The player must click on a point on the map to make a guess, and the game calculates the distance between the real location and the player's guess, awarding points based on the accuracy of the guess.

## How to Play

1. The game will display an image of a location.
2. The player must click on the map where they believe the image was taken.
3. After making the guess, the game will calculate the distance between the real location and the player's guess.
4. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guess (the closer, the more points).
5. The player can see their accumulated score throughout the game.


### Features
- Score based on the distance between the guess and the correct location, using an exponential decay system.
